# Stalwart Mailserver with HAProxy and Docker

A complete, production-ready Docker configuration for Stalwart Mailserver behind HAProxy with PROXY protocol support. Solves the problems with real client IPs, Docker NAT, and dynamic IP addresses.

## 🎯 The Problem

- Stalwart in a Docker container
- Docker NAT hides real client IPs (SPF shows `softfail` with `172.x.x.x`, fail2ban inside the container will block that single address)
- `network_mode: host` needed for HAProxy (real client IPs), but then Docker DNS is unavailable
- Dynamic Docker IPs (`172.17.x.x`, `172.18.x.x`, ...) can change on every restart
- Stalwart needs `trusted-networks` with stable IP ranges

## ✅ The Solution

- **HAProxy** as TCP proxy with PROXY protocol v2 for SMTP, Submission, IMAP, POP3
- **Fixed IP range** via Docker IPAM (e.g., `10.42.37.0/24`) – no more wandering IPs
- **/etc/hosts mount** in HAProxy container for stable name resolution (bypasses Docker DNS in host mode)
- **Trusted Networks** in Stalwart configured to the fixed IP range
- **Lighttpd** (or *nginx*) as reverse proxy and HTTPS handler with working certificate right from start

## Stalwart Configuration (Admin UI)

When you start Stalwart the first time (e.g. with the `setup.sh` script), you
go through three stages of configuration, the first two without the HAProxy,
because the container is not ready yet for the send-proxy-v2 protocol.

### Bootstrap

Here, you only have to set your domain name, and get an actual admin account,
not just the recovery account that does this setup.

After this Bootstrap setup, you need to restart the container.

### Initial Network Setup

In Management -> Networks -> General scroll down to Proxy, Trusted Networks, and add those three:
```
172.16.0.0/12
fd00::/8
10.0.0.0/8
```

This enables the send-proxy-v2 protocol.  The three networks can possibly
receive packets, but actually, since we pin the address of the container, we
actually need only the last one.

### Administration Setup

## ⏱️ Timeout Configuration Explained

The HAProxy configuration uses service-specific timeouts to accommodate different use cases:

| Service | Port | Timeout | Reason |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **SMTP** | 25 | 300s | Manual telnet testing, large email transfers |
| **Submission** | 587 | 60s | Normal email submission |
| **SMTPS** | 465 | 60s | Normal email submission (legacy) |
| **IMAP** | 993 | 3600s | **IMAP IDLE** – keeps connection open for push notifications |
| **POP3** | 995 | 60s | Short connections, fetch and disconnect |

### Why Different Timeouts?

- **IMAP IDLE** allows email clients (Thunderbird, iPhone Mail, Outlook) to receive push notifications without constantly polling. A longer timeout (1 hour or even 24 hours) keeps the connection alive.
- **SMTP on port 25** needs a longer timeout for manual debugging with telnet. Writing a test email manually can take several minutes.
- **POP3 and Submission** are designed for short, transaction-based connections – they don't benefit from long timeouts.

### Adjusting IMAP Timeout for 24/7 IDLE

If you want even longer IMAP IDLE support (e.g., for mobile devices that keep connections open overnight):

```haproxy
backend stalwart_imap
    timeout client  86400s   # 24 hours
    timeout server  86400s
    server stalwart stalwart:10143 send-proxy-v2
```

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/forthy42/stalwart-haproxy-docker
cd stalwart-haproxy-docker

# Run setup
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Replace ${DOMAIN} in the rest of the text here with your actual domain, and
${USER} with the user name(s).

Stalwart Admin Web Interface: https://mail.${DOMAIN}/admin

## ⚠️ Known Issues and Solutions

### 1. Stalwart: 550 5.1.2 Relay not allowed

**Problem:** Occurs when using an alias domain instead of the primary domain name. Aliases are only loaded after the primary name is used.

**Solution:** Connect once manually via telnet:

```bash
telnet mail.${DOMAIN} 25
EHLO example.org
MAIL FROM: <example@example.org>
RCPT TO: <${USER}@${DOMAIN}>
QUIT
```

After this, all aliases work – they are loaded by the primary domain query.

### 2. SPF softfail with 172.x.x.x

**Problem:** Docker NAT hides real client IPs

**Solution:** PROXY protocol as configured above – Stalwart will see the real IP.

### 3. Dynamic Docker IPs keep changing

**Problem:** `172.17.x.x`, `172.18.x.x`, etc. change on every restart

**Solution:** Fixed IP range via Docker IPAM (see compose file).

### 4. HAProxy cannot find Stalwart (host mode)

**Problem:** In host mode, Docker DNS (`127.0.0.11`) doesn't work

**Solution:** Pin Stalwart container to address 10.42.37.2 and mount `/etc/hosts`

### 5. Web connection during setup “not secure”

Browsers nowadays deny sending a password to a server that has no secure
connection.  So neither the http-only access through Stalwart's native port
8080 is feasible, nor the access through port 443, because there, you get a
self-signed certificate.

Once you install a propper certificate, the access through port 443 (mapped to
9443) is possible.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Internal Stalwart ports (`25`, `587`, etc.) are **not** exposed
- Only HAProxy communicates with Stalwart via the isolated network
- PROXY protocol prevents IP spoofing through `trusted-networks`
- Lighttpd is used as frontend for the web, using the `Forward:` protocol
- No direct incoming connections to Stalwart possible

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Domain with correct DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) — Stalwart will create the entries for you
- **Netcup-specific:** Allow port 25 in server firewall (blocked by default since December 2025)
- Alternative DNS providers: Cloudflare (as hosting and/or resolver), deSEC (as hosting)

## 🔄 Alternative DNS Providers

- **Cloudflare:** Fast DNS propagation, good resolver (`1.1.1.1`), native Stalwart integration (since v0.16) as hoster
- **deSEC:** Native Stalwart integration (since v0.16) as hoster
- **Netcup:** Manual DNS entries or API via community tools

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### View logs
```bash
docker compose logs haproxy
docker compose logs stalwart
```

### Test PROXY protocol
```bash
docker logs stalwart | grep -i "remoteIp"
# Should show real client IP, not 172.x.x.x
```

### Test SMTP directly
```bash
telnet mail.${DOMAIN} 25
EHLO example.org
MAIL FROM: <example@example.org>
RCPT TO: <${USER}@${DOMAIN}>
DATA
Subject: Test

Test message
.
QUIT
```
